New to GitHUB , found it cool !!
Hi, I am Gamvir Khanal a 1st year ohh now 2nd year student. GitHUB is cool no? We can post our project publically and also copy other's code 😉. So yeah here I begin my journey into the GitHUB.
Wow !! we can also develop a branch with all the old things plus new things and the main thing is still as it is. That's even more cool 😍
